We often consider sculpture as the art of the solid, of mass, of volume occupying space. But in my vision, the void is just as important, if not more so.

The void is not nothingness. It is a space of tension. When I create an opening in a form, or leave a space between two masses, I am "sculpting" the air. That air vibrates. Light passes through it, creating shadows that would not exist without that void.

Architecture taught me that habitable space is defined by walls, but life happens in the void between them. Similarly, the emotion of a sculpture often happens in what is not there, in the interval, in the breath that the work grants to the gaze.

The void is an invitation. It invites the observer to enter, to mentally complete the form, to become part of the work. It is in the void that the mystery resides.
