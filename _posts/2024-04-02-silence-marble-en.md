Before every stroke of the chisel, there is silence. Marble is not just crystallized calcium carbonate; it is time. Geological time, compressed time, silent time.

Approaching a block of marble requires humility. It is not about imposing a will, but discovering a possibility. Michelangelo spoke of liberating the imprisoned figure; I prefer to think of giving voice to a silence that has lasted for millions of years.

The white dust that rises in the studio is not waste, it is the breath of the stone opening up. Working marble is an act of subtraction, but also of extreme delicacy. A blow too hard can "wound" the stone, creating invisible internal fractures that compromise its soul.

In the silence of marble, I find the peace of the gesture. Every curve, every polished surface is nothing but a caress given to time, in an attempt to make it eternal.
