Matter is never inert. It possesses a voice, a breath, a soul waiting only to be revealed. In my work, I do not seek to impose a form upon matter, but rather to listen to what it has to say.

Stone, wood, metal, ceramic: each material has its own geological or biological memory, a specific resistance, a unique way of reflecting or absorbing light. Sculpting means resonating with these intrinsic qualities. It is a dialogue, sometimes a struggle, but always an act of love and understanding.

> "Art is not representation, but revelation."

When I touch clay, I feel its plasticity, its willingness to become something else. When I work stone, I feel its resistance, its millennial history compressed into a dense block. My task is to remove the superfluous, to liberate the energy trapped within.

Space is not a void in which to place the object, but a field of forces that interacts with it. Sculpture activates space, bends it, densifies it. And light is the final instrument that defines volumes, creates shadows, gives rhythm to perception.

In every work, I seek that precarious and perfect point of balance where matter ceases to be weight and becomes pure emotion. That is where the soul resides.
